\chapter{Improved Global Urban Localization Based on Road Maps and Detection of Road Intersections}

\section{Introduction}

In the previous approach, partially known road maps and low quality dead reckoning information are processed by a Monte Carlo fusion algorithm for globally localizing a vehicle in urban context under denial of GPS signal \cite{guivant2007global}. However, it could temporarily present weak observability in cases where the vehicle does not perform turning actions (e.g. changing roads) for large traveled distances. The effect of this problem is evidenced as an increase of the uncertainty in the estimated position in the longitudinal direction of the platform.

In order to improve the observability of the estimation process, additional observations need to be provided and these observations must be informative in the subspace corresponding to the longitudinal dimension of the position. Relevant observations for that purpose can be acquired through the detection of road intersections and other infrastructure usually present in urban or other road contexts.
